# Mantus LLM Training and Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for designing, training, and deploying a Large Language Model (LLM) as the "neural heart" of Mantus. This document assumes you have access to significant computational resources and is intended for teams with expertise in machine learning and deep learning.

## 1. Pre-Training Phase

### 1.1 Data Collection and Preparation

The foundation of any powerful LLM is the data it is trained on. For Mantus, you will need to assemble a massive, diverse corpus of text data.

#### Data Sources

*   **Common Crawl**: A freely available web crawl containing petabytes of web content.
*   **Wikipedia**: High-quality, encyclopedic content.
*   **Books**: Project Gutenberg, OpenLibrary, and other sources for literary content.
*   **Academic Papers**: ArXiv, PubMed, and other academic repositories.
*   **Code Repositories**: GitHub, GitLab, and other code hosting platforms (essential for code-related tasks).
*   **News Archives**: Various news sources for current events and diverse perspectives.
*   **Domain-Specific Corpora**: Depending on Mantus's intended use cases (e.g., medical literature, legal documents, scientific papers).

#### Data Preprocessing

Once collected, the data must be cleaned and preprocessed:

1.  **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate documents and passages to avoid the model learning redundant patterns.
2.  **Filtering**: Remove low-quality content, spam, and irrelevant material.
3.  **Tokenization**: Convert raw text into tokens using a tokenizer (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding). This step defines the vocabulary of the model.
4.  **Formatting**: Organize data into a format suitable for training (e.g., TFRecord files for TensorFlow, or HuggingFace datasets).
5.  **Quality Assurance**: Implement checks to ensure data quality and diversity.

### 1.2 Model Architecture Design

#### Hyperparameter Selection

Key hyperparameters for the Transformer architecture include:

| Hyperparameter | Typical Range | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Model Size (Parameters) | 1B - 1T | Total number of learnable parameters. Larger models generally perform better but require more compute. |
| Hidden Dimension | 768 - 12288 | Dimensionality of the hidden states in each Transformer layer. |
| Number of Layers | 12 - 96 | Depth of the Transformer stack. Deeper models can capture more complex patterns. |
| Number of Attention Heads | 8 - 128 | Number of parallel attention mechanisms. More heads allow for diverse attention patterns. |
| Attention Head Dimension | 64 | Typically hidden_dim / num_heads. |
| Feed-Forward Dimension | 2048 - 49152 | Dimensionality of the feed-forward networks within each layer. |
| Vocabulary Size | 32000 - 128000 | Number of unique tokens in the tokenizer. |
| Context Length (Max Sequence Length) | 512 - 32768 | Maximum number of tokens the model can process in a single input. Longer contexts allow for more complex reasoning. |
| Batch Size | 256 - 4096 | Number of examples processed in each training step. Larger batches improve stability but require more memory. |
| Learning Rate | 1e-4 - 1e-3 | Step size for gradient descent. Often decayed over training. |
| Dropout Rate | 0.0 - 0.2 | Regularization technique to prevent overfitting. |

#### Architecture Variants

Several architectural variants have shown promise:

*   **Decoder-Only (Autoregressive)**: Models like GPT that generate text one token at a time. Suitable for Mantus's task of understanding and responding to user input.
*   **Encoder-Decoder**: Models like T5 that have separate encoder and decoder stacks. Useful for tasks like translation and summarization.
*   **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Models that use multiple specialized sub-networks, activated conditionally. Can improve efficiency and performance.

For Mantus, a **decoder-only autoregressive architecture** is recommended, as it aligns well with the agent loop's need for sequential reasoning and response generation.

### 1.3 Training Infrastructure

#### Hardware Requirements

Training a large LLM requires substantial computational resources:

*   **GPUs/TPUs**: High-end accelerators (e.g., NVIDIA H100, Google TPU v4) for parallel computation.
*   **Memory**: High-bandwidth memory (HBM) on accelerators and system RAM for storing model weights and intermediate activations.
*   **Interconnect**: High-speed networking (e.g., NVLink, InfiniBand) for distributed training across multiple devices.
*   **Storage**: Fast, large-capacity storage for datasets and checkpoints (e.g., NVMe SSDs, cloud object storage).

#### Distributed Training

For models with billions of parameters, training must be distributed across multiple devices:

*   **Data Parallelism**: Replicate the model across devices, each processing a different batch of data. Gradients are aggregated.
*   **Model Parallelism**: Split the model across devices, with different layers on different devices. Requires careful orchestration of forward and backward passes.
*   **Pipeline Parallelism**: Divide the model into stages, with each stage on a different device. Allows for better GPU utilization.
*   **Tensor Parallelism**: Split individual tensors across devices, allowing for finer-grained parallelism.

Popular frameworks for distributed training include:

*   **PyTorch**: With `torch.distributed` or libraries like DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM.
*   **TensorFlow**: With `tf.distribute` strategies.
*   **JAX**: With `jax.distributed` for fine-grained control.

### 1.4 Training Process

#### Optimization

The training process involves minimizing a loss function (typically cross-entropy loss for next-token prediction) using gradient descent:

1.  **Forward Pass**: Input sequences are passed through the model to produce logits (unnormalized probabilities) for the next token.
2.  **Loss Computation**: The cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual next tokens is computed.
3.  **Backward Pass**: Gradients of the loss with respect to all model parameters are computed using backpropagation.
4.  **Gradient Aggregation**: In distributed training, gradients are aggregated across devices.
5.  **Parameter Update**: Model parameters are updated using an optimizer (e.g., AdamW) with the computed gradients.

#### Training Dynamics

*   **Learning Rate Scheduling**: The learning rate is often reduced over time (e.g., cosine annealing) to fine-tune the model as training progresses.
*   **Gradient Clipping**: Large gradients are clipped to prevent instability.
*   **Checkpointing**: Model weights are periodically saved to allow recovery from interruptions and selection of the best model.
*   **Monitoring**: Loss, perplexity, and other metrics are tracked to assess training progress.

#### Estimated Training Time

For a model with 7 billion parameters trained on 1-2 trillion tokens (a reasonable target for a capable general-purpose LLM):

*   **With 1000 H100 GPUs**: Approximately 2-4 weeks.
*   **With 100 H100 GPUs**: Approximately 20-40 weeks.
*   **With 10 H100 GPUs**: Approximately 200-400 weeks.

These estimates assume efficient distributed training and may vary based on specific configurations.

## 2. Fine-Tuning Phase

After pre-training, the model can be fine-tuned on task-specific or instruction-following data to improve its performance on desired behaviors.

### 2.1 Instruction Fine-Tuning

Create a dataset of (instruction, output) pairs and fine-tune the model to follow instructions better. This typically involves:

1.  **Data Collection**: Gather or generate instruction-output pairs relevant to Mantus's intended tasks.
2.  **Fine-Tuning**: Train the model on this data for a few epochs, using a lower learning rate than pre-training.
3.  **Evaluation**: Assess the model's ability to follow instructions and generate appropriate responses.

### 2.2 Tool Use Fine-Tuning

To enable Mantus to effectively select and use tools, fine-tune the model on examples of tool usage:

1.  **Tool Schema Definition**: Define the available tools and their parameters in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
2.  **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generate examples of the model selecting tools based on user requests.
3.  **Fine-Tuning**: Train the model to generate tool calls in the correct format.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

RLHF is a powerful technique for aligning the model with human preferences and values.

### 3.1 Reward Model Training

1.  **Data Collection**: Have humans rank pairs of model outputs (e.g., "Output A is better than Output B").
2.  **Reward Model**: Train a separate model to predict which output humans prefer based on the rankings.
3.  **Validation**: Validate the reward model's predictions against held-out human rankings.

### 3.2 Policy Optimization

Using the reward model, optimize the LLM using reinforcement learning:

1.  **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A popular RL algorithm that updates the model to maximize expected reward while staying close to the original model.
2.  **Iterative Refinement**: Repeat the process of collecting human feedback, updating the reward model, and optimizing the policy.

## 4. Deployment and Integration

### 4.1 Model Serving

Once trained, the model must be deployed for inference:

*   **Quantization**: Reduce model precision (e.g., from float32 to int8) to decrease memory requirements and increase inference speed.
*   **Batching**: Group multiple inference requests together for efficiency.
*   **Caching**: Cache attention weights and other intermediate values to speed up generation.
*   **Serving Framework**: Use frameworks like vLLM, Ray Serve, or TensorFlow Serving for efficient model serving.

### 4.2 Integration with Mantus Agent Loop

Integrate the trained LLM into Mantus's agent loop:

1.  **LLM Wrapper**: Create a wrapper class (similar to `llm_component.py`) that handles communication with the deployed model.
2.  **Prompt Engineering**: Develop prompts that guide the LLM to perform the "Think" step of the agent loop effectively.
3.  **Tool Integration**: Ensure the LLM can generate tool calls in the correct format for Mantus's ToolOrchestrator.
4.  **Context Management**: Implement context management to maintain conversation history and task state across multiple agent loop iterations.

## 5. Evaluation and Benchmarking

### 5.1 Benchmarks

Evaluate the model on standard benchmarks:

*   **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: Tests knowledge across diverse domains.
*   **HellaSwag**: Tests commonsense reasoning.
*   **LAMBADA**: Tests language modeling and context understanding.
*   **HumanEval**: Tests code generation capabilities.
*   **Custom Benchmarks**: Create benchmarks specific to Mantus's intended use cases (e.g., tool selection, task planning).

### 5.2 Human Evaluation

Conduct human evaluations to assess:

*   **Helpfulness**: Does the model provide useful responses?
*   **Harmlessness**: Does the model avoid generating harmful content?
*   **Honesty**: Does the model acknowledge uncertainty and avoid hallucinating?
*   **Tool Usage**: Does the model correctly select and use tools?

## 6. Continuous Improvement

### 6.1 Monitoring and Feedback

In production, monitor the model's performance and collect user feedback:

*   **Logging**: Log all user interactions and model outputs.
*   **Metrics**: Track key metrics like user satisfaction, task completion rate, and error rates.
*   **Feedback Loop**: Collect human feedback on model outputs and use it to identify areas for improvement.

### 6.2 Iterative Updates

Periodically update the model based on collected feedback:

*   **Fine-Tuning**: Perform additional fine-tuning on new data or based on identified weaknesses.
*   **RLHF Iterations**: Conduct additional RLHF rounds to further align the model with human preferences.
*   **Version Management**: Maintain versioning of models to allow rollback if issues arise.

## 7. Conclusion

Building a state-of-the-art LLM like the one powering Mantus is a complex, resource-intensive endeavor. However, with careful planning, substantial computational resources, and expertise in machine learning, it is achievable. This guide provides the roadmap; the execution will require a dedicated team of researchers and engineers.

For those without the resources to train from scratch, consider starting with a pre-trained open-source model (e.g., Llama, Mistral) and fine-tuning it for Mantus's specific use cases. This approach can yield impressive results with a fraction of the computational cost.
