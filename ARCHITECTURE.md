# Mantus Architecture and Design Blueprint

## Overview

Mantus is an autonomous general AI agent designed to replicate the full spectrum of capabilities demonstrated by Manus AI. This document outlines the architectural design, core components, and integration strategy for building Mantus as a fully functional AI assistant.

## 1. Core Architecture

### 1.1 Agent Loop

Mantus operates through an iterative agent loop that follows these steps:

1. **Analyze Context**: Understand the user's intent and current state based on available information.
2. **Think**: Reason about whether to update the plan, advance the phase, or take a specific action.
3. **Select Tool**: Choose the next tool for function calling based on the plan and state.
4. **Execute Action**: The selected tool will be executed as an action in the environment.
5. **Receive Observation**: The action result will be appended to the context as a new observation.
6. **Iterate Loop**: Repeat the above steps patiently until the task is fully completed.
7. **Deliver Outcome**: Send results and deliverables to the user.

### 1.2 Core Components

Mantus's architecture consists of the following core components:

#### TaskManager
Responsible for managing task planning, phase creation, phase advancement, and goal tracking. The TaskManager maintains the current plan and ensures that tasks are broken down into manageable phases.

#### CommunicationManager
Handles all user interactions, including sending messages, asking questions, and delivering results. The CommunicationManager ensures clear and structured communication with the user.

#### ToolOrchestrator
Coordinates the invocation of various tools based on the current task and phase. The ToolOrchestrator determines which tool to use and manages the execution flow.

#### ContextManager
Maintains the current context, including task history, previous observations, and state information. This allows Mantus to reason about decisions and maintain continuity across iterations.

### 1.3 Large Language Model (LLM) Architecture (The "Neural Heart")

To truly mirror the capabilities of Manus AI, Mantus requires a foundational Large Language Model (LLM) as its core intelligence. This LLM will be responsible for understanding natural language, generating responses, reasoning about tasks, and facilitating tool selection. Given the user's commitment to providing extensive resources, the design will focus on a state-of-the-art, transformer-based architecture.

#### 1.3.1 Model Type: Transformer Architecture

For Mantus, a **decoder-only autoregressive architecture** is recommended, as it aligns well with the agent loop's need for sequential reasoning and response generation. While the internal workings of such models are complex, several open-source options provide excellent starting points or can be fine-tuned to serve as Mantus's core. A detailed comparison and recommendations for these models are provided in the `open_source_llm_comparison.md` document.



The most effective LLMs today are built upon the **Transformer architecture** [1]. This architecture is particularly well-suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and natural language understanding/generation. Key characteristics include:

*   **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence relative to each other, capturing long-range dependencies.
*   **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the sequence, as the self-attention mechanism itself is permutation-invariant.
*   **Encoder-Decoder Structure (or Decoder-only)**: While the original Transformer had both, many modern LLMs (especially for generation) use a decoder-only stack of layers.

#### 1.3.2 Core Components of the LLM

An LLM of this scale typically comprises the following high-level components:

*   **Tokenization Layer**: Converts raw text into numerical tokens that the model can process. This involves:
    *   **Tokenizer**: Breaks down text into subword units (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, SentencePiece).
    *   **Vocabulary**: A mapping of tokens to unique integer IDs.
    *   **Embedding Layer**: Converts token IDs into continuous vector representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning.

*   **Transformer Blocks (Layers)**: The core computational units of the LLM. Each block typically contains:
    *   **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Computes attention weights across different "heads" to capture diverse relationships between tokens.
    *   **Feed-Forward Networks**: Position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks applied to each position independently.
    *   **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**: Used to stabilize training and improve gradient flow through deep networks.

*   **Output Layer**: Transforms the final hidden states from the Transformer blocks into a probability distribution over the vocabulary, typically using a linear layer followed by a softmax activation function.

#### 1.3.3 Training Regimen

Training an LLM of this magnitude involves several stages:

*   **Pre-training**: The model is trained on a massive corpus of text (and potentially other modalities like code, images, audio) using self-supervised objectives, such as predicting the next word or filling in masked words. This phase is computationally intensive and aims to learn general language understanding and generation capabilities.
*   **Fine-tuning (Optional but Recommended)**: After pre-training, the model can be fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets to adapt it for particular applications (e.g., instruction following, summarization, question answering). This often involves supervised learning with labeled data.
*   **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Optional but Highly Effective)**: A crucial step for aligning the model with human preferences and making it more helpful, harmless, and honest. This involves training a reward model based on human rankings of model outputs, and then using reinforcement learning to optimize the LLM against this reward model.

#### 1.3.4 Integration with Agent Loop

Regardless of whether a foundational LLM is trained from scratch or an existing open-source model is adopted, its integration into Mantus's agent loop as the primary "Think" component remains crucial. The LLM will:

1.  **Interpret User Input**: Understand the user's request and current context.
2.  **Reason and Plan**: Formulate a high-level plan to achieve the user's goal, breaking it down into sub-tasks.
3.  **Tool Selection**: Based on the current sub-task, select the most appropriate tool from Mantus's available toolset.
4.  **Tool Argument Generation**: Generate the necessary arguments for the selected tool based on the current context and task requirements.
5.  **Process Tool Output**: Interpret the observations received from tool execution and update the internal state.
6.  **Generate Responses**: Formulate natural language responses to the user, providing updates, asking clarifying questions, or delivering results.

### 1.3.5 Recommended Open-Source LLMs for Mantus

For Mantus to truly mirror Manus's comprehensive capabilities, a careful selection of its core Large Language Model (LLM) is paramount. Based on extensive research and comparative analysis (detailed in `open_source_llm_comparison.md`), the following open-source LLMs are highly recommended:

1.  **Llama 3.1 [1]**: Offers frontier-level performance, explicit agentic focus, deep customization potential, and an extensive 128K context window. Its robust foundation makes it ideal for general-purpose agentic AI.
2.  **Qwen3 [3]**: Stands out for its strong agentic optimizations, including hybrid thinking modes for efficiency, and unparalleled multilingual support (119 languages). It is particularly well-suited for agents that need to intelligently manage reasoning processes and interact globally.
3.  **DeepSeek-V3 [2]**: Provides exceptional reasoning capabilities, especially in technical domains like coding and mathematics, coupled with an efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This is an excellent choice if Mantus is expected to perform complex analytical and problem-solving tasks.

A hybrid approach, utilizing one of these powerful LLMs as the primary reasoning engine and integrating specialized smaller models (e.g., CodeGemma or PaliGemma 2 [5]) as dedicated tools for specific tasks, could offer the most comprehensive solution. The ultimate choice will depend on available computational resources and the desired weighting of Mantus's capabilities.



Regardless of whether a foundational LLM is trained from scratch or an existing open-source model is adopted, its integration into Mantus's agent loop as the primary "Think" component remains crucial. The LLM will:

## 2. Tool Integration

To overcome the limitations identified in `MANUS_LIMITATIONS_AND_MANTUS_ENHANCEMENTS.md`, Mantus will integrate several new architectural components and tool categories, transforming its capabilities in long-term memory, autonomous planning, real-world interaction, self-correction, and multimodal processing. These enhancements are designed to provide Mantus with a more proactive, adaptive, and context-aware operational framework.

### 2.1 Enhanced Long-Term Memory System

Mantus's memory system will move beyond transient context to incorporate persistent, structured, and semantically rich long-term memory, crucial for continuous learning and personalized interactions. This will involve a hybrid approach:

#### 2.1.1 Vector Database Integration

*   **Purpose**: To store and efficiently retrieve episodic memories (past interactions, observations, tool outputs) and semantic knowledge (facts, concepts) as high-dimensional vector embeddings. This enables rapid similarity-based retrieval, crucial for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and contextual recall.
*   **Recommended Technologies**: 
    *   **Pinecone**: For managed, scalable, and high-performance vector search in production environments [6].
    *   **Weaviate**: An open-source, modular, and extensible option supporting hybrid search and custom ML workflows [6].
    *   **Qdrant**: A high-speed, Rust-backed solution optimized for real-time use cases and privacy-focused deployments [6].
*   **Integration**: The `ContextManager` will be enhanced to encode relevant information into vectors using a dedicated embedding model (e.g., a component of the core LLM or a specialized embedding model like `text-embedding-ada-002`). These embeddings will be stored in the chosen vector database. During the "Think" phase of the agent loop, the `ContextManager` will query the vector database to retrieve contextually relevant memories based on the current task and conversation history.

#### 2.1.2 Knowledge Graph Integration

*   **Purpose**: To store factual knowledge, complex relationships between entities, and learned rules in a structured, queryable format. This enables advanced reasoning, inference, and grounding of information, addressing the limitation of purely statistical LLMs.
*   **Recommended Technologies**: 
    *   **Neo4j (Property Graph)**: Highly recommended for its flexibility, efficiency in handling complex relationships, and intuitive query language (Cypher). Property graphs are superior to RDF triple stores for analytical and application development due to their native graph storage and ease of incremental changes [7].
    *   **Other Property Graph Databases**: Such as ArangoDB, JanusGraph, or Amazon Neptune, depending on specific scalability and deployment needs.
*   **Integration**: A new `KnowledgeGraphTool` will be developed, allowing the LLM to query and update the knowledge graph. The `ContextManager` will use the knowledge graph to retrieve structured facts and relationships that enrich the LLM's understanding and reasoning capabilities, particularly for tasks requiring logical inference or adherence to specific rules.

### 2.2 Proactive Goal Setting and Autonomous Planning Module

To move beyond a purely reactive mode, Mantus will incorporate advanced planning capabilities:

#### 2.2.1 Hierarchical Planning Module

*   **Purpose**: Enables the LLM to not only break down user-defined goals but also to proactively generate sub-goals, anticipate future steps, and manage complex, multi-stage projects autonomously. This module will allow for more sophisticated, long-term task management.
*   **Mechanism**: The `TaskManager` will be augmented with a `PlanningAgent` (an LLM-driven component) capable of recursive task decomposition and goal prioritization. This agent will leverage both the `ContextManager` (drawing from long-term memory) and the `ToolOrchestrator` (to understand available actions) to construct detailed execution plans.

#### 2.2.2 Internal Simulation Environment

*   **Purpose**: To allow Mantus to "mentally" test potential actions, evaluate their outcomes, and refine strategies in a simulated environment before committing to real-world (tool) execution. This significantly reduces trial-and-error, improves efficiency, and enhances safety.
*   **Integration**: A new `SimulationTool` will be introduced. This tool will provide a lightweight, abstract model of the environment (e.g., a mock file system, a simplified web browser, or a state-based task simulator). The LLM can invoke this tool to simulate sequences of actions and observe their effects, receiving feedback that informs its planning and decision-making without actual external interaction.

### 2.3 Expanded Real-World Interaction and Embodiment Interfaces

While full physical embodiment remains a long-term vision, Mantus will be designed with enhanced interfaces for broader real-world interaction:

#### 2.3.1 Robotics API Integration

*   **Purpose**: To enable Mantus to interface with robotic platforms for tasks requiring physical manipulation, sensor data processing, or control of automated systems.
*   **Integration**: A new `RoboticsTool` category will be added, containing wrappers for common robotics frameworks (e.g., ROS - Robot Operating System) or specific robot APIs. These tools will allow Mantus to send commands to robots and receive sensor feedback, expanding its operational domain into the physical world.

#### 2.3.2 IoT Device Control

*   **Purpose**: To interact with Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., smart home systems, industrial sensors, smart appliances) for monitoring, control, and automation tasks.
*   **Integration**: A new `IoTControlTool` category will be introduced, providing standardized interfaces for various IoT protocols (e.g., MQTT, Zigbee, Home Assistant API). This will allow Mantus to query device states, send control commands, and automate processes in connected environments.

#### 2.3.3 Advanced Sensory Input Tools

*   **Purpose**: To process complex sensor data beyond basic text and images, allowing for nuanced perception of the environment.
*   **Integration**: New tools will be developed for specialized processing, such as:
    *   **Computer Vision Libraries**: For detailed object recognition, scene understanding, and facial analysis (e.g., OpenCV, custom ML models).
    *   **Audio Processing Libraries**: For speech recognition, sentiment analysis from voice, and sound event detection (e.g., Whisper, custom audio models).
    *   **Other Sensor Data Processors**: For interpreting data from environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, lidar, radar).

### 2.4 Advanced Self-Correction and Meta-Learning for Tool Use

Mantus will feature mechanisms for continuous self-improvement and adaptive tool-use strategies:

#### 2.4.1 Meta-Learning Module

*   **Purpose**: To enable Mantus to learn *how to learn* and adapt its problem-solving strategies based on past experiences, particularly in tool selection and argument generation. This moves beyond simple error recovery to fundamental strategic improvement.
*   **Mechanism**: The `ToolOrchestrator` will log detailed metadata about every tool invocation, including inputs, outputs, success/failure status, and the context in which it was used. This data will feed into a `MetaLearningAgent` (an LLM-driven or separate ML component) that analyzes patterns of success and failure. This agent will refine the LLM's internal heuristics for tool selection and prompt generation, allowing it to adapt its strategy for novel or challenging scenarios [8].

#### 2.4.2 Experimentation Framework

*   **Purpose**: To systematically explore alternative tool-use strategies when faced with novel or persistent failures, generating new data for the RL module and accelerating self-correction.
*   **Integration**: A new `ExperimentationTool` will be added. When the LLM encounters a task it cannot solve with its current strategies, this tool will guide it to systematically try different combinations of tools, parameters, or approaches. The outcomes of these experiments will be recorded and used by the `MetaLearningAgent` for further learning.

### 2.5 Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation

To achieve seamless interaction across different data types, Mantus will aim for a more integrated multimodal capability:

#### 2.5.1 Multimodal Core LLM

*   **Purpose**: Ideally, Mantus's core LLM will be inherently multimodal, trained on interleaved text, image, and audio data. This allows for a unified understanding and generation across modalities, similar to how humans perceive and interact with the world.
*   **Mechanism**: This would require selecting an open-source LLM (or developing one) that supports multimodal inputs and outputs from its foundational architecture. The `llm_component` would be updated to handle these diverse data types directly.

#### 2.5.2 Integrated Multimodal Tool Orchestration

*   **Purpose**: If a single multimodal LLM is not immediately feasible, Mantus will tightly integrate specialized multimodal tools through a common interface, ensuring seamless data flow and contextualization.
*   **Mechanism**: The `ToolOrchestrator` will manage the conversion and contextualization of multimodal data. For example, an `ImageUnderstandingTool` would process an image and return structured descriptions or captions that the text-based LLM can directly reason over. Similarly, the LLM could generate text prompts for `ImageGenerationTool` or `AudioGenerationTool`, and the orchestrator would manage the execution and integration of results.
