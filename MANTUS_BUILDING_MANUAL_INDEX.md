## Overview

This comprehensive manual provides step-by-step instructions for building **Mantus**, an advanced autonomous AI agent that mirrors and extends the capabilities of Manus. The manual is organized into 8 phases, each building upon the previous one to create a production-ready, intelligent system.

### What is Mantus?

Mantus is a sophisticated autonomous AI agent designed to:

- **Think and Reason:** Powered by a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM)
- **Act and Execute:** Orchestrate tools and external systems to accomplish goals
- **Remember and Learn:** Maintain both short-term and long-term memory with continuous improvement
- **Correct and Improve:** Detect and recover from errors autonomously
- **Understand Multimodal Input:** Process text, images, and audio simultaneously
- **Scale Reliably:** Deploy and operate at production scale with monitoring and observability

---

## Manual Structure

The manual is divided into 8 comprehensive phases, each with detailed implementation guidance, code examples, and best practices.

### Phase 1-2: Foundation and Intelligence
**File:** `MANTUS_BUILDING_MANUAL_PHASE_1_2.md`

These foundational phases establish the core infrastructure and integrate the LLM that serves as Mantus's "neural heart."

**Key Topics:**
- Development environment setup (Python, Docker, dependencies)
- Repository structure and project organization
- LLM provider integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- LLM wrapper implementation with multiple provider support
- Configuration management and secrets handling
- Initial testing of LLM integration

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Key Deliverables:** Working LLM integration with multiple provider support

---

### Phase 3-4: Capabilities and Memory
**File:** `MANTUS_BUILDING_MANUAL_PHASE_3_4.md`

These phases implement the tool orchestration system and memory infrastructure that enable Mantus to interact with external systems and maintain context.

**Key Topics:**
- Tool registry and schema definition
- Tool orchestrator for managing tool selection and execution
- Built-in tools implementation (shell, file operations, web search)
- Episodic memory (short-term, session-specific)
- Semantic memory (long-term, persistent knowledge)
- Task planning and decomposition
- Agentic loop implementation

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Key Deliverables:** Full tool orchestration system with memory management

---

### Phase 5-6: Intelligence and Learning
**File:** `MANTUS_BUILDING_MANUAL_PHASE_5_6.md`

These phases implement advanced capabilities for error recovery, multimodal processing, and continuous learning.

**Key Topics:**
- Error detection and analysis
- Error recovery strategies and management
- Self-correction mechanisms
- Multimodal processing (images, audio, text)
- Feedback collection and analysis
- Continuous learning from interactions
- RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) integration

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Key Deliverables:** Self-correcting, learning-enabled agent with multimodal capabilities

---

### Phase 7-8: Quality and Production
**File:** `MANTUS_BUILDING_MANUAL_PHASE_7_8.md`

These final phases ensure Mantus is production-ready with comprehensive testing, deployment automation, and operational procedures.

**Key Topics:**
- Testing strategy and framework (unit, integration, system, performance)
- Test implementation and coverage
- Deployment pipeline and automation
- Kubernetes deployment configuration
- Monitoring and observability (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Incident response and operational runbooks
- Scaling and performance optimization

**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 days  
**Key Deliverables:** Production-ready system with full monitoring and operational procedures
